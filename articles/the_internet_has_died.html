            centralization and monetization have been immense disasters for the internet.
            what once was a tool made by the people for the people is now a hellhole built by
            soulless corporations and has almost completely lost its charm. everybody (including me)
            is now stuck with using the same 5 multi-billion dollar company products over and over and
            very few people know html and/or css, let alone have their own websites. corporations have ruined
            the fun and charm of the internet and the damage is virtually irreversible.

            for me, one of the big appealing aspects of sites like spacehey is the fact that i can personalize
            my profile just the way i want it to be. sure, this is great, but it's no replacement to the
            individual websites of the past, and, ultimately, it's still just a social media platform
            rather than a completely unique and personal space on the internet.
            <br><br><br>
            html and css are very easy to learn, i personally advise everyone to at least make a stab
            at writing a website at least once in their life, even if it doesn't work out the first time,
            it's a learning experience. who knows? maybe you'll like it. and by doing so, you're also keeping
            the people's internet alive.
